Configuration files for the CHILI model intercomparison project.
Website: https://nexss.info/cuisines/chili-mip/

The `protocol/` subfolder contains the two configurations used in the protocol paper.

To ensure that the PROTEUS are consistent with each other for the main intercomparison,
there is a single base configuration file `intercomp/_base.toml` from which planet-specific
configuration files are generated in the `intercomp/` directory. These configurations may
be generated by running the `intercomp/_generate.py` script.
