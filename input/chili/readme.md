Configuration files for the CHILI model intercomparison project.
Website: https://nexss.info/cuisines/chili-mip/
GitHub for CHILI: https://github.com/projectcuisines/chili

The `protocol/` subfolder contains the two configurations used in the protocol paper.

To ensure that the PROTEUS are consistent with each other for the main intercomparison,
there is a single base configuration file `intercomp/_base.toml` from which planet-specific
configuration files are generated in the `intercomp/` directory. These configurations may
be generated by running the `tools/chili_generate.py` script.

To execute steps for the intercomparison:

1) Install PROTEUS
2) Generate configuration files
    - $ ./tools/chili_generate.py
3) Run Earth/Venus grids and process them
    - E.g. for Earth...
    - $ proteus grid -c input/chili/intercomp/earth.grid.toml
    - $ ./tools/chili_postproc.py output/chili_earth_grid
4) Run TRAPPIST-1 cases and process them
    - E.g. for TRAPPIST-1 b...
    - $ proteus start -c input/chili/intercomp/tr1b.toml
    - $ ./tools/chili_postproc.py output/chili_tr1b
