# Meeting Notes 08/05

## Science Question

What is the main science question?

What gases are of interest?

What would the planetary parameters be?

## Model Structure

Surface temperature out of interior, atmosphere calculates OLR -- is this definite?

Do we stick with the existing script-calling interface, or rewrite in Cython -- could couple it to the existing ExoFMS Fortran interface (Graham and Xianyu might be interested, or doing the same thing for clouds project).

## Spectral Files

Default files are fine for testing

What species would we need?

What range of temperatures and pressures?

CIA data?

See Amundsen files and data
