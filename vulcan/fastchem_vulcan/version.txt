This is a modified FastChem code (https://github.com/exoclime/fastchem) adopting the NASA 9-coefficients to couple with VULCAN.
The the main change of this FastChem 2.0 version is allowing arbitrary elemental compositions.

The steps I have done to change the original fastchem:
1. Providing nasa9_logK_NCHOTi.dat
2. Modify mass_action_constant.cpp for calculating log_K (of all elements too)
3. In model_main.cpp, change the ouput names: e.g. P (bar) => P
