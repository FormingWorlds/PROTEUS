## PROTEUS ecosystem rules

PROTEUS couples separate module repositories into one model of the evolution of rocky planets and their atmospheres. Its config selects one module per process; the config values are the lowercase names:

- `interior_energetics.module`: `aragog`, `spider` (or the built-in `boundary`); `interior_struct.module`: `zalmoxis`, `spider`
- `atmos_clim.module`: `agni`, `janus`, both with SOCRATES spectral radiative transfer
- `outgas.module`: `calliope`, `atmodeller`; `atmos_chem.module`: `vulcan`
- `star.module`: `mors`; `escape.module`: `zephyrus`, `boreas`; `orbit.module` (tides): `obliqua`, `lovepy`
- fwl-io downloads the reference data the modules use

A module change to anything PROTEUS calls or reads (a function signature, a config key, an output column, a unit) can break the coupled model while the module's own tests pass. Search `src/proteus/` in PROTEUS for the name before you change it, and name the affected PROTEUS call sites in the pull request.

### Physics and numerics

- Units differ between and within modules: MORS and VULCAN use cgs; CALLIOPE and atmodeller work with pressures in bar; AGNI takes surface pressure in bar at setup and holds Pa inside; PROTEUS states the unit of every `hf_row` key in `GetHelpfileKeys` (`src/proteus/utils/coupler.py`: atmospheric pressures in bar, interior pressures in Pa, model time in years, orbital periods in s), and its config reference pages state each key's unit (for example stellar mass in M_sun, initial partial surface pressures in bar, stellar age in Gyr). State the unit of every physical quantity in its docstring and convert explicitly at the boundary: a unit mismatch between two modules passes the tests of both and shows only in the coupled run.
- A physics test must fail for the most plausible wrong formula: check a conservation law, a bound, a monotonicity, or a published or analytical value, and assert that the wrong result falls outside the tolerance.
- Take each physical constant from one source per repository (in Python `scipy.constants` or the module's constants file). Two retyped values of one constant differ at round-off and hide real differences between code paths.
- Do not loosen a solver tolerance, a conservation check or a clamp to make a run or a test pass. Find the cause; a loosened check also hides the next defect.

### Branches and pull requests

- Work on a feature branch `<initials>/<short-description>`; `main` changes only through a reviewed pull request.
- Fill every section of the repository's pull-request template, where it has one.
- Before you push, run the checks listed at the top of this `AGENTS.md` and in `tests/AGENTS.md`.

### Where knowledge goes

Rules for every contributor go in the `AGENTS.md` files, the reason for a change in its commit message and pull-request description, and the scientific validation of a module in its `docs/Validation/` pages, where the repository has them. Do not add memory, notes or decision-log files to the repository: nobody maintains them, and they go stale.
