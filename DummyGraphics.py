#This is a dummy graphics routine, to import if a graphics driver
#is not found. It is the fallback import if the import of ClimateGraphics
#fails in ClimateUtilities.  This dummy routine allows courseware
#scripts to be run without the user needing to comment out plot commands.
#It also can be used as a template for customizing the plotter interface
#to work with you locally favored Python graphics driver (e.g. MatPlotLib).
