## 2. Active Context (The "Now")

### Current Sprint Focus (Last 20 Commits)
**Period**: 2026-01-20 to 2026-01-31

**Primary Objective**: Harden CI/CD infrastructure and achieve comprehensive test coverage ✅ ACHIEVED

**Major Activities**:
1. **Julia Installation Fix - CRITICAL** (commits: d02ebb13, e395b0df - 2026-01-31)

   - Enhanced failure guidance for developers

### Recent Architectural Changes
- **Docker CI Architecture**: Fully operational with pre-built images (`ghcr.io/formingworlds/proteus:latest`)
- **Test Categorization**: Four-tier system (unit, smoke, integration, slow) with clear CI gates
- **Coverage Strategy**: Dual-threshold system (fast gate for PR, full gate for nightly)
- **Nightly Workflow**: v5 architecture with 90-minute timeout, comprehensive coverage reporting

### Active Branches
- **main**: Production branch with nightly validation
- **tl/test_ecosystem_v5**: Active development branch for CI/CD improvements

---

## 3. Architectural Decisions (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Docker-Based CI/CD (2026-01)
**Decision**: Use pre-built Docker images for all CI/CD workflows instead of compiling on every run.

**Reasoning**:
- Compilation of SOCRATES, PETSc, SPIDER, AGNI takes ~60 minutes per PR
- Pre-built image reduces PR feedback time from 60+ min to 10-15 min
- Smart rebuild only recompiles changed files (make handles this)
- Nightly builds at 02:00 UTC ensure image stays current

**Implementation**: `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`, image at `ghcr.io/formingworlds/proteus:latest`

**Trade-offs**: Adds complexity (Docker maintenance) but massive developer experience improvement

---

### ADR-002: Four-Tier Test Categorization (2026-01)
**Decision**: Categorize tests into unit, smoke, integration, and slow with pytest markers.

**Reasoning**:
- **Unit** (<100ms, mocked): Fast feedback on Python logic
- **Smoke** (1 timestep, real binaries): Binary validation without full physics
- **Integration**: Multi-module coupling tests
- **Slow** (hours): Full scientific validation

**Why This Matters**:
- PR checks run unit + smoke (~10 min) for fast feedback
- Nightly runs full suite including slow tests
- Prevents regression while maintaining developer velocity

**Implementation**: `@pytest.mark.{unit,smoke,integration,slow}` in `pyproject.toml`

---

### ADR-003: Automatic Coverage Ratcheting (2026-01)
**Decision**: Coverage thresholds automatically increase, never decrease.

**Reasoning**:
- Prevents coverage regression
- Encourages incremental improvement
- Two thresholds: fast gate (unit+smoke) and full gate (all tests)
- Script `tools/update_coverage_threshold.py` runs on main branch pushes

**Current Thresholds**:
- Fast gate: 44.45% (`[tool.proteus.coverage_fast]`)
- Full gate: 69% (`[tool.coverage.report]`)

**Why This Matters**: Ensures test quality never degrades, even as codebase grows

---

### ADR-004: Editable Installs for All Ecosystem Modules (Ongoing)
**Decision**: All Python submodules installed with `pip install -e .` for development.

**Reasoning**:
- Enables live code changes without reinstallation
- Simplifies debugging across module boundaries
- Required for integrated ecosystem development
- Installation order matters (dependencies: MORS → JANUS → CALLIOPE → ARAGOG → ZEPHYRUS)

**Trade-off**: More complex setup, but essential for multi-repo development

---

### ADR-005: Test Structure Mirrors Source Structure (Established)
**Decision**: `tests/<module>/test_<filename>.py` must mirror `src/proteus/<module>/<filename>.py`

**Reasoning**:
- Enforces 1:1 mapping between source and tests
- Validated by `tools/validate_test_structure.sh`
- Makes it obvious where tests belong
- Prevents orphaned tests

**Enforcement**: CI runs validation script; PRs fail if structure violated

---

### ADR-006: No Float Equality Comparisons (Established)
**Decision**: Never use `==` for float comparisons; always use `pytest.approx()` or `np.testing.assert_allclose()`.

**Reasoning**:
- Floating-point arithmetic is inherently imprecise
- Physics simulations accumulate numerical errors
- Prevents flaky tests from rounding differences

**Enforcement**: Documented in `AGENTS.md`, enforced in code review

---

### ADR-007: PETSc from OSF, Not Built from Source (Established)
**Decision**: Download pre-compiled PETSc from OSF instead of building from source.

**Reasoning**:
- Building PETSc from source takes 30+ minutes
- Specific version required for SPIDER compatibility
- Pre-compiled version is platform-specific (arch-linux-c-opt, arch-darwin-c-opt)
- Reduces installation complexity

**Implementation**: `tools/get_petsc.sh` downloads from OSF

---

## 4. Known Debt & "Watch Outs"

### ~~**CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE: Julia Version Incompatibility**~~ ✅ RESOLVED
**Status**: Fixed as of 2026-01-31 (commits d02ebb13, e395b0df)

**Problem**: AGNI required Julia ~1.11 but Docker container had broken Julia installation via juliaup

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **juliaup installation was incomplete** - created broken symlinks and missing sys.so library
2. **Symlink approach failed** - Julia looked for libraries at `/usr/local/bin/../lib/julia/sys.so` instead of actual installation path
3. **Duplicate Julia configuration** - CI workflow had redundant setup steps

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Replaced juliaup with direct Julia 1.11.2 download** (Dockerfile)
   - Download from julialang.org official tarball
   - Extract to `/opt/julia-1.11.2/`
   - Add to PATH via ENV instead of symlink to preserve library paths
2. **Simplified CI Julia configuration** (ci-nightly-science-v5.yml)
   - Removed duplicate Julia setup step
   - Rely on Docker installation with minimal env vars
   - Trust `get_agni.sh` to handle Julia package installation

**Verification** (workflow run 21542390853):
- ✅ Docker build successful (19m19s)
- ✅ Fast PR Checks passing
- ✅ Julia 1.11.2 loads correctly in CI
- ✅ Unit tests run with >0% coverage
- ✅ Smoke tests execute successfully
- ✅ Integration tests complete
- ✅ Slow tests execute
- ✅ Nightly workflow completes (58m17s, 1 test failure unrelated to infrastructure)

**Key Lesson**: Always use direct Julia installation from official tarballs for production Docker images; juliaup is designed for interactive use, not containerized environments.

---

### Documentation Drift
- **Issue**: Some test documentation references old workflow names
- **Impact**: Low (workflows themselves are correct)
- **Action**: Ongoing cleanup as workflows stabilize

### Code Hotspots (Fragile/Complex Areas)

#### 1. AGNI Integration (`src/proteus/atmos_clim/agni.py`)
- **Why Fragile**: Julia-Python bridge via juliacall
- **Recent Changes**: Atmosphere allocation fixes (commit 980b441b)
- **Watch Out**: Memory management across language boundary
- **Test Coverage**: Integration tests in `tests/integration/test_integration_aragog_agni.py`

#### 2. Data Download System (`src/proteus/utils/data.py`)
- **Why Complex**: Handles Zenodo, OSF, network failures, offline mode
- **Recent Changes**: Security improvements, validation enhancements (commits 9986961d, 1eec4bad)
- **Watch Out**: Network-dependent tests require careful mocking
- **Test Coverage**: `tests/utils/test_data.py` with unit tests

#### 3. Configuration System (`src/proteus/config/`)
- **Why Complex**: TOML parsing, validation, type conversion, defaults
- **Recent Changes**: Enhanced unit tests (commit 6d4394a6)
- **Watch Out**: Nested configuration validation, type coercion edge cases
- **Test Coverage**: `tests/config/test_config.py`, `test_converters.py`, `test_options.py`

#### 4. CI Workflow Summary Generation (`.github/workflows/ci-nightly-science-v5.yml`)
- **Why Fragile**: Parses JUnit XML, coverage JSON, handles failures
- **Recent Changes**: Hardened with try/except, better error handling (commit 7ed06597)
- **Watch Out**: Missing files, parse errors can crash summary step
- **Mitigation**: Wrapped in exception handling, writes minimal summary on error

### Unfinished Business (TODOs in Codebase)

Found 4 TODOs across codebase:
1. `src/proteus/grid/manage.py` - Grid management optimization
2. `src/proteus/interior/aragog.py` - Interior evolution edge cases
3. `src/proteus/observe/wrapper.py` - Observation module enhancements
4. `tests/utils/test_utils.py` - Additional utility test cases

**Priority**: Low (not blocking current work)

### Test Skips (Placeholders)
- **JANUS/SOCRATES**: Some tests skipped due to instability
- **AGNI**: Some tests require Julia binaries (nightly only)
- **CALLIOPE**: Slow tests run in nightly only
- **Data tests**: Network-dependent tests mocked in unit, real in integration

**Strategy**: Gradually remove skips as stability improves; use `PROTEUS_CI_NIGHTLY=1` gating for expensive tests

### Coverage Gaps (As of 2026-01-30)
- **Current**: 69% overall, 44.45% fast suite
- **Target**: Incremental improvement via ratcheting
- **Focus Areas**: Use `bash tools/coverage_analysis.sh` to identify low-coverage modules

## 5. Critical Workflows & Commands

### Developer Daily Commands
```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate proteus

# Run fast tests (what PR checks run)
pytest -m "unit and not skip"
pytest -m "smoke and not skip"

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html

# Lint (always before commit)
ruff check --fix src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/

# Validate test structure
bash tools/validate_test_structure.sh

# Coverage analysis
bash tools/coverage_analysis.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. **PR Opened**: `ci-pr-checks.yml` runs (unit + smoke + lint, ~10-15 min)
2. **PR Merged to main**: Coverage ratcheting updates thresholds
3. **Nightly 02:00 UTC**: `docker-build.yml` rebuilds image
4. **Nightly 03:00 UTC**: `ci-nightly-science-v5.yml` runs full suite (unit → smoke → integration → slow, ~90 min)

### Installation Sequence (Developer)
**Critical**: Follow exact order due to dependencies
1. Set `FWL_DATA` and `RAD_DIR` environment variables
2. Install SOCRATES (Fortran)
3. Install AGNI (Julia)
4. Install Python submodules in order: MORS → JANUS → CALLIOPE → ARAGOG → ZEPHYRUS
5. Install PETSc (from OSF)
6. Install SPIDER (requires PETSc)
7. Install PROTEUS framework: `pip install -e ".[develop]"`
8. Enable pre-commit: `pre-commit install -f`

---

## 6. Ecosystem Context

### Multi-Repository Structure
PROTEUS is the orchestrator; each module is a separate GitHub repository:
- FormingWorlds/PROTEUS (main)
- FormingWorlds/CALLIOPE
- FormingWorlds/JANUS
- FormingWorlds/MORS
- FormingWorlds/aragog
- FormingWorlds/ZEPHYRUS
- nichollsh/AGNI
- nichollsh/SOCRATES
- djbower/spider

**Implication**: Changes may require coordinated updates across repositories

### Testing Standards Apply Ecosystem-Wide
All modules follow same standards:
- Test structure mirrors source
- Coverage ratcheting
- pytest markers (unit, smoke, integration, slow)
- ruff formatting
- Same CI/CD patterns

---

## 7. Recent Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Nightly Workflow Timeouts (2026-01-28)
**Problem**: Nightly workflow cancelled at 55 minutes, slow tests never ran.

**Root Cause**: Unit + smoke + integration exceeded 55-minute timeout.

**Solution**: Increased timeout to 90 minutes (commit 7ed06597).

**Takeaway**: Always budget time for full test suite; slow tests need 10-15 min alone.

---

### Lesson 2: Summary Script Robustness (2026-01-28)
**Problem**: Summary generation step failed when tests failed, hiding actual test failures.

**Root Cause**: Script exited before writing summary if files missing or parse errors.

**Solution**: Wrapped all summary generation in try/except; write minimal summary on error.

**Takeaway**: Error handling in CI scripts must be bulletproof; always write *something* to help debugging.

---

### Lesson 3: AGNI Memory Management (2026-01)
**Problem**: AGNI integration tests occasionally failed with memory errors.

**Root Cause**: Atmosphere allocation not properly managed across Julia-Python boundary.

**Solution**: Enhanced allocation logic in `src/proteus/atmos_clim/agni.py` (commit 980b441b).

**Takeaway**: Cross-language boundaries require explicit resource management.

---

### Lesson 4: Julia Installation in Docker Containers (2026-01-30 to 2026-01-31) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Nightly workflow runs 21532123452, 21533333930, 21541854157, 21542063539, 21542156510 all failed with Julia library errors.

**Root Causes** (discovered through systematic debugging):
1. **Initial assumption wrong**: First thought it was Julia 1.12.4 vs 1.11 version mismatch
2. **Actual issue #1**: `juliaup` created incomplete installation with broken symlinks
3. **Actual issue #2**: Symlink at `/usr/local/bin/julia` caused Julia to look for libraries at `/usr/local/bin/../lib/julia/sys.so` instead of actual path `/opt/julia-1.11.2/lib/julia/sys.so`
4. **Actual issue #3**: Duplicate Julia configuration steps in CI workflow added complexity

**Error Evolution**:
- Initial: `julia version requirement for package at /opt/proteus/AGNI not satisfied`
- After first fix: `ERROR: could not load library "/usr/local/bin/../lib/julia/sys.so"`
- After second fix: ✅ Julia loads successfully

**Solution** (commits d02ebb13, e395b0df):
1. Replace `juliaup` with direct Julia 1.11.2 tarball download from julialang.org
2. Add Julia to PATH via `ENV PATH="/opt/julia-1.11.2/bin:${PATH}"` instead of symlink
3. Simplify CI workflow to rely on Docker installation with minimal env vars
4. Remove duplicate Julia configuration step

**Verification** (workflow run 21542390853):
- Docker build: 19m19s ✅
- Fast PR Checks: passing ✅
- Nightly workflow: 58m17s, all test stages executed ✅

**Takeaway**:
- **juliaup is for interactive use, not Docker** - use official tarballs for containers
- **Symlinks break library path resolution** - use PATH environment variable instead
- **Trust upstream installation scripts** - `get_agni.sh` handles Julia packages correctly
- **Systematic debugging pays off** - don't stop at first hypothesis; verify each fix thoroughly

---

### Lesson 5: Security in Data Downloads (2026-01-30)
**Problem**: Potential command injection vulnerability in Zenodo download functions.

**Root Cause**: Zenodo IDs passed directly to subprocess without sanitization.

**Solution**: Added regex validation (`^[0-9]+$`) for Zenodo IDs in `download_zenodo_folder()` and `validate_zenodo_folder()`.

**Takeaway**: Always sanitize external inputs before passing to subprocess, even if they seem safe.

---

### Lesson 6: CI Dependency Management (2026-01-30)
**Problem**: Disk space monitoring failed because `bc` utility not available in container.

**Root Cause**: Assumed system utilities without verifying container contents.

**Solution**: Replaced `bc` with Python for disk space calculations; made checks non-blocking.

**Takeaway**: Don't assume system utilities; use Python or verify dependencies in Docker image.

---

## 8. Future Roadmap (Known Priorities)

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days) - CRITICAL
- **Fix Julia version incompatibility**: Update Dockerfile to use Julia 1.11.x
- **Verify AGNI loads**: Test Julia setup in nightly workflow
- **Validate smoke tests**: Ensure all 11 smoke tests run (not skipped)

### Short-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
- Continue expanding integration test coverage (ARAGOG+AGNI, CALLIOPE+ZEPHYRUS)
- Remove remaining test skips as stability improves
- Maintain coverage ratcheting momentum
- Add pytest-timeout plugin to Docker image for better test timeout control

### Medium-Term (Next 2-3 Months)
- Multi-architecture Docker support (ARM64 for Apple Silicon)
- Matrix testing across Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Performance profiling and benchmarking

### Long-Term (6+ Months)
- Semantic versioning for stable releases
- Artifact caching for FWL_DATA between CI runs
- Enhanced documentation with interactive examples
